## all-cabal-files

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-files.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-files)

A repository containing all of the cabal files for all public Haskell packages

Note that this repository is not structured for easy viewing on Github. Instead, the focus is making it easy to use for tools, in particular, `cabal-install`. For more information, please see the discussion on [issue #1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-files/issues/1).
